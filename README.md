# BlueGlove

# About
BlueGlove is a service that provides brick-and-mortar stores with data and tools to engage and reward their loyal customers.
When a customer using this app walks into participating store (equipped with an iBeacon), the app will send data about that customer being at the store to a datastore via a server. Later, the store owner can use this app to view information about all of her customers, what they've purchased, how often they've been at the store, and for how long. Then, the store owner can define cohorts of users and send coupons to get them to come into the store. This service both rewards customers for their loyalty and provide store owners with valuable marketing data.
